<p>the sea emperor a highly intelligent leviathen class life form which ranges anywhere from 160m t0 200m which calls 4546B its home.It is an old creature
    was alive about a few million years ago before riley entered the planet however they were all extinct except 1 the 1 which the architects[basically alieans]tried to recreate after analyzing each creature and the dead remains why because of 1 reason a plague called karra a dangerous disease which broke out because of the architects
</p>
<p> but why keep a creature like this alive well the sea emperor has a substance in its stomach called enzyme 42 which cures the karra bacteria however this sea emperor had a unstable version of enzyme 42 and instead of permanently curing it it stopped its effect for a short time</p>
